# Security & Compliance

Implement comprehensive security hardening, compliance measures, and content moderation across the entire ShareStack platform to ensure data protection, regulatory compliance, and safe user experience.

## Security Hardening

### Application Security
- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation
  - OAuth 2.0 + JWT security audit and hardening
  - Session management with secure token rotation
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) validation

- **API Security**
  - Rate limiting and DDoS protection implementation
  - API key management and rotation policies
  - Input validation and sanitization audit
  - SQL injection and XSS prevention measures

- **Infrastructure Security**
  - HTTPS/TLS 1.3 enforcement across all endpoints
  - Database encryption at rest and in transit
  - Secure file storage with access controls
  - Container security and vulnerability scanning

### Data Protection & Privacy
- **Encryption & Key Management**
  - End-to-end encryption for sensitive user data
  - Secure key management with hardware security modules
  - Payment data encryption and PCI DSS compliance
  - File encryption for user-generated content

- **Access Controls**
  - Principle of least privilege enforcement
  - Administrative access audit and controls
  - User data access logging and monitoring
  - Secure backup and recovery procedures

## Compliance Framework

### GDPR Compliance
