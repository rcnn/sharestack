# Task 001: Infrastructure Foundation

## Overview

Establish the foundational infrastructure for ShareStack platform including Docker containerization, database setup, caching layer, and CI/CD pipeline. This task creates the technical backbone that all other components will depend on.

## Context from PRD

According to the ShareStack PRD (sections 4.1.3, 4.2), the platform requires:

> **基础设施架构**:
> - 容器化: Docker + Docker Compose  
> - 部署: Docker Compose (生产环境)
> - 负载均衡: Nginx 
> - 数据库: MySQL 8.0 (主) + Redis 7 (缓存)

> **数据库设计**: 
> - 读写分离: MySQL主从架构
> - 索引优化: 复合索引和覆盖索引
> - 缓存策略: Redis多层缓存

## Technical Specifications

### Docker Environment Setup
- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Multi-service orchestration for development and production
- **Service Containers**: API service, MySQL, Redis, Nginx load balancer
- **Volume Management**: Persistent data storage for database and file uploads
- **Network Configuration**: Internal service communication and external access
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management with .env files

### Database Architecture
- **MySQL 8.0 Primary**: Core application data with InnoDB engine
- **Database Schema**: Initial tables for users, contents, subscriptions, payments
- **Index Strategy**: Optimized composite indexes for query performance
- **Migration System**: Alembic-based schema version control
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery

### Redis Caching Layer
- **Redis 7 Configuration**: Multi-purpose caching and session storage
- **Cache Strategies**: Application cache, session storage, queue management
- **Data Persistence**: RDB + AOF persistence for reliability
- **Memory Optimization**: Proper memory limits and eviction policies

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment workflows
- **Docker Registry**: Container image management and versioning
- **Environment Promotion**: Development → Staging → Production pipeline
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing, security scanning, performance checks

## Acceptance Criteria

### Development Environment

### Load Balancing
- [ ] Nginx container configured as reverse proxy
- [ ] SSL/TLS termination setup with Let's Encrypt integration
- [ ] Static file serving optimized with proper caching headers
- [ ] Health check endpoints for all backend services
- [ ] Rate limiting configured to prevent abuse
- [ ] Request logging and monitoring setup

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing on pull requests  
- [ ] Docker image building and registry push on main branch
- [ ] Automated deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Database migration automation in deployment pipeline
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management
- [ ] Security scanning integrated into pipeline

## Technical Implementation Details

### Docker Compose Services Structure
```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: ./backend
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://user:password@db:3306/sharestack
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
    depends_on: [db, redis]
    
  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=sharestack
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
      
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    command: redis-server --appendonly yes
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
      
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports: ["80:80", "443:443"]
    depends_on: [api]
```

### Initial Database Schema Priority
1. **User Management**: users, user_auth, user_profiles tables
2. **Content System**: contents, content_versions, content_tags tables  
3. **Subscription System**: subscription_plans, subscriptions tables
4. **Payment System**: payments, payouts tables
5. **Core Indexes**: Performance-critical queries optimization

### Redis Configuration Strategy
- **Database 0**: Session storage and user authentication
- **Database 1**: Application-level caching (query results, computed data)
- **Database 2**: Task queue and background job management
- **Database 3**: Rate limiting and temporary data

### Security Considerations
- Database passwords and API keys stored in environment variables
- Redis password authentication enabled
- Network isolation between services
- Regular security updates automated through dependabot
- SSL certificates automated renewal with certbot

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on development machines
- Cloud provider account (AWS/Alibaba Cloud) for production deployment
- Domain name registered for SSL certificate generation
- GitHub repository setup for CI/CD integration

### Internal Dependencies
- This task blocks all subsequent development as it provides the infrastructure foundation
- No dependencies on other tasks - can start immediately
- Must be completed before authentication system (Task 002) can begin database integration

## Effort Estimation
**Size**: Large (L)  
**Estimated Time**: 3-5 days  
**Complexity**: Medium - Standard infrastructure setup with some customization needs

### Breakdown:
- Day 1-2: Docker Compose environment setup and service configuration
- Day 3: Database schema design and migration system setup  
- Day 4: Redis configuration and caching strategy implementation
- Day 5: CI/CD pipeline setup and testing integration

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Improper indexing could impact query performance
  - *Mitigation*: Performance testing with realistic data volumes during setup
- **Container Resource Limits**: Services may compete for resources
  - *Mitigation*: Proper resource allocation and monitoring setup
- **Data Persistence**: Risk of data loss during container restarts
  - *Mitigation*: Proper volume mounting and backup procedures testing

### Operational Risks  
- **Environment Consistency**: Development vs production environment drift
  - *Mitigation*: Infrastructure as code approach with version control
- **Deployment Complexity**: Manual deployment errors
  - *Mitigation*: Fully automated CI/CD pipeline with rollback capabilities

## Success Metrics
- All services start successfully with zero manual intervention
- Database queries execute under 50ms for basic operations
- Redis cache hit rate above 80% for session and application data
- CI/CD pipeline completes full cycle (build → test → deploy) under 10 minutes
- System handles 100 concurrent connections without performance degradation

## Deliverables
1. **docker-compose.yml** - Complete orchestration configuration
2. **Database Schema** - Initial Alembic migrations with core tables
3. **Redis Configuration** - Production-ready Redis setup
4. **Nginx Configuration** - Reverse proxy and SSL termination
5. **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions workflow files
6. **Documentation** - Setup guide and operational procedures
7. **Environment Scripts** - Automated setup and maintenance scripts

This infrastructure foundation enables all subsequent development phases and ensures scalable, maintainable platform architecture from day one.
