# Epic: ShareStack Platform Implementation

## Overview

ShareStack is a Chinese knowledge monetization platform implementing a modern full-stack architecture with Next.js + FastAPI + MySQL. This epic converts the comprehensive PRD into 10 strategic technical task categories following an MVP-first approach across three development phases.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ App Router + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS + Zustand
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic + Python 3.11+
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 (primary) + Redis 7 (cache/sessions/queues)
- **Storage**: AWS S3/Alibaba OSS + CloudFlare CDN
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose + Nginx load balancer

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Monolith-First Strategy**: Start with well-structured monolith, design for microservices extraction
2. **Database Simplification**: Single MySQL primary + Redis caching (no read replicas in MVP)
3. **Search Strategy**: MySQL full-text search + Redis caching (no Elasticsearch complexity)
4. **Media Processing**: Leverage cloud provider capabilities vs. self-built transcoding
5. **Payment Priority**: Domestic payment methods first (WeChat/Alipay), international as Phase 2

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **PC Application**: Next.js with App Router, shadcn/ui component system
- **Mobile Application**: React Native + Expo SDK 50+ for cross-platform delivery
- **State Management**: Zustand for predictable state with TypeScript support
- **Data Layer**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure token rotation

### Backend Services
- **API Architecture**: RESTful design with FastAPI automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Data Models**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 models with async support and proper relationships
- **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth2.0 with RBAC permission system
- **Task Processing**: Celery + Redis for background job processing
- **File Management**: Direct cloud upload with server-side validation

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose for development and production
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx for SSL termination and static file serving
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging with centralized aggregation
- **Security**: HTTPS enforcement, input validation, SQL injection protection
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling ready with stateless API design

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 - Core MVP (8 weeks)
Focus on essential functionality: Infrastructure + Authentication + Content + Payment
**Goal**: Validate core value proposition with functional content publishing and subscription

### Phase 2 - Feature Enhancement (6 weeks)
Add multimedia support, search/recommendation, and social features
**Goal**: Complete user experience with discovery and engagement features

### Phase 3 - Scale Preparation (4 weeks)
Analytics, mobile app, and security hardening
**Goal**: Production-ready platform with compliance and observability

### Risk Mitigation
- **Payment Integration**: Staged testing with sandbox environments and comprehensive financial reconciliation
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Fallback strategies and circuit breaker patterns
- **Performance**: Proactive monitoring and load testing before user growth

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing**: 80%+ coverage for business logic components
- **Integration Testing**: API endpoint testing with realistic data scenarios
- **E2E Testing**: Critical user journeys with Playwright automation
- **Security Testing**: Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

## Task Breakdown Preview

- **Mobile Experience**: Native app performance with offline capabilities

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline
**Total Development Time**: 18 weeks (4.5 months)
- Phase 1 (MVP): 8 weeks - Core functionality
- Phase 2 (Enhancement): 6 weeks - User experience features
