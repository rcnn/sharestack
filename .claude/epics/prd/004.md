# Task: Media Asset Management

## Overview
Implement comprehensive media asset management system with cloud storage integration, CDN delivery, and automated processing pipeline for ShareStack platform.

## Context
Users need to upload, manage, and deliver media assets (images, documents, videos) efficiently with global CDN distribution. The system must integrate with Chinese cloud providers (Aliyun OSS) while providing fallback options.

## Acceptance Criteria

### File Upload System
- [ ] Implement secure multipart file upload with progress tracking
- [ ] Support multiple file types: images (jpg, png, webp), documents (pdf, docx), videos (mp4, mov)
- [ ] File size validation: images ≤10MB, documents ≤50MB, videos ≤500MB
- [ ] Virus scanning integration before storage
- [ ] Generate unique file identifiers with collision protection
- [ ] Upload progress indication with real-time updates

### Cloud Storage Integration
- [ ] Primary storage: Aliyun Object Storage Service (OSS) integration
- [ ] Fallback storage: AWS S3 compatibility layer
- [ ] Automatic bucket organization by content type and date
- [ ] Secure signed URL generation with configurable expiration
- [ ] Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
- [ ] Storage lifecycle management (archive old files after 365 days)

### CDN Integration
- [ ] Aliyun CDN integration for China market optimization
- [ ] Cloudflare CDN for global delivery outside China
- [ ] Intelligent routing based on user geography
- [ ] Cache invalidation API for updated content
- [ ] Image optimization and format conversion (WebP, AVIF)
- [ ] Bandwidth monitoring and cost optimization

### Media Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Automatic image resizing and thumbnail generation
- [ ] Multiple resolution variants (thumbnail, medium, large, original)
- [ ] Video transcoding for web-optimized formats
- [ ] Document preview generation (PDF thumbnails)
- [ ] Metadata extraction (EXIF, file properties)
- [ ] Async processing with queue system (Bull/Redis)

### Security & Access Control
- [ ] Integration with authentication system (depends on 002)
- [ ] Role-based media access permissions
- [ ] Watermark application for premium content
- [ ] HTTPS-only delivery with certificate management
- [ ] Anti-hotlinking protection
- [ ] Rate limiting for upload endpoints

### API Endpoints
- [ ] `POST /api/media/upload` - Multipart file upload
- [ ] `GET /api/media/:id` - File metadata and access URL
- [ ] `DELETE /api/media/:id` - Secure file deletion
- [ ] `PUT /api/media/:id` - Update file metadata/permissions
- [ ] `GET /api/media/search` - Media library search and filtering
- [ ] `POST /api/media/batch` - Bulk operations

### Database Schema
- [ ] Media assets table with metadata storage
- [ ] Processing status tracking table
- [ ] Access logs for analytics and security
- [ ] Storage provider configuration table
- [ ] User quota tracking and enforcement

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Upload speed: >1MB/s for files >10MB
- [ ] CDN cache hit ratio: >95% for frequently accessed files
- [ ] Thumbnail generation: <5 seconds for images <10MB
- [ ] Global CDN latency: <200ms for cached content
- [ ] Concurrent uploads: Support 100+ simultaneous uploads

### Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Storage usage tracking per user/organization
- [ ] CDN bandwidth monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Failed upload tracking and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Processing queue health monitoring
- [ ] Cost tracking across storage providers

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **Storage**: Aliyun OSS (primary), AWS S3 (fallback)
- **CDN**: Aliyun CDN, Cloudflare
- **Processing**: Sharp (images), FFmpeg (videos), PDF-lib (documents)
- **Queue**: Bull with Redis backend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for metadata

### Dependencies
- Task 001 (Infrastructure): Redis, PostgreSQL, monitoring setup
- Task 003 (Content System): Integration with content management

### Risk Mitigation
- **China compliance**: Use Aliyun services with ICP filing
- **Vendor lock-in**: Implement abstraction layer for storage providers
- **Processing failures**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Storage costs**: Implement intelligent tiering and compression

## Effort Estimation
**Size**: L (3-5 days)
- Cloud provider integration: 1 day
- Upload system and API: 1 day  
- Processing pipeline: 2 days
- CDN integration and testing: 1 day

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed and tested
- [ ] Integration tests covering upload/download flows
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent uploads
- [ ] Security audit of file handling and access controls
- [ ] CDN performance validation across regions
- [ ] Documentation for API endpoints and configuration
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards for storage and CDN metrics
